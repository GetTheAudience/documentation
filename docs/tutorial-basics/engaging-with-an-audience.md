# Engaging with an audience

Now that you know **what** they talk about, **who** are the most active people, and **at what time of day** they tweet, it's time to **jump in and engage** with them.

:::tip
You will want to talk to those people, understand their problems and needs, and then create a product for them to solve their problems. Value for them, money for you!
:::

This is the easiest step, and it is only one:

1. Click on a **tweet**,
2. or Click on the image of a **person** on Twitter, to engage in the conversation.

**GetTheAudience will open Twitter** for you, right **on that tweet or person**, so that you can join the conversation right away!
