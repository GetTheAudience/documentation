# Engaging with an audience

Now that you know what they talk about, who are the most active people, and at what time of day they tweet, it's time to jump in and engage with them.

Why? Well, you will want to talk to those people, understand their problems and needs, and then create a product for them to solve their problems.

This is the easiest step, and it is only one:

- Click on a Tweet, or click on the image of a Twitter Handle, to engage in the conversation.

GetTheAudience will open Twitter for you so that you can join the conversation right away.
