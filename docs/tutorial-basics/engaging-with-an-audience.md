# Engaging with an audience

Now that you know **what** they talk about, **who** are the most active people, and **at what time of day** they tweet, it's time to **jump in and engage** with them.

:::tip
You will want to talk to those people, understand their problems and needs, and then create a product for them to solve their problems. Value for them, money for you!
:::

There are **two ways** to do this:

- Do it immediately to get some initial ideas
- Create a persona first, give it some jobs to be done, and ask your audience later whether you made those assumptions correctly.

## Engaging immediately

This is the easiest step, and it is only one:

1. Click on a **tweet**,
2. or Click on the image of a **person** on Twitter, to engage in the conversation.

**GetTheAudience will open Twitter** for you, right **on that tweet or person**, so that you can join the conversation right away!

A “Persona” is a fictional representation of an actual user of your product. Use them to…

* **Drive design decisions** by taking common user needs to design a new feature
* **Get a clear understanding** of users, in terms of goals and challenges
* **Analyze the jobs** that this persona wants to get done with your product

Personas can be immensely helpful, so read on, see the next page!
