# Creating an audience

An audience is a group of people who have a conversation with each other, therefore they automatically have something in common.

You can create an audience, using these steps:

1. In the menu on the left, click on `Audiences`
2. Click the button `New audience`
3. Enter a `name` and a short `description` of the audience, then confirm with `Create audience`.

## Sending an elf to import tweets for you

The audience looks still empty. Fill it with their conversations by sending an elf to listen for you on Twitter:

1. Click `Send first elf to listen`
2. Enter the name of a **Twitter handle** in the input field
3. Choose whether the elf should import tweets `from`, `to`, and/or `mentioning` this Twitter handle
4. Confirm with `Import those tweets`.

The elf will work in the background, possibly for several minutes. The audience on your screen will update itself regularly while the elf is running.

:::caution

You can commission **more than one elf** to import tweets into the same audience. However, you should do this **only if** the other people have a **conversation with the same people**. If you import totally unrelated tweets, your data will become diluted and less meaningful.

It is better to create **separate audiences** for **unrelated** Twitter accounts.

## Which audiences you should create first

:::tip
The **easiest thing** to begin with is your own audience, i.e. you enter **your own Twitter handle** in the input field for the elf.
:::

Another **good idea** is to create **one audience for each competitor** of yours. When you listen there, you might discover problems that you can solve better than your competitors.

An **advanced idea** is to create **one audience for each person** or company **who makes things** that your audience is using. Example: If you want to create a product for bloggers, enter [@iAWriter](https://twitter.com/iAWriter) or [@Wordpress](https://twitter.com/Wordpress). The idea behind this is: Bloggers use iAWriter or Wordpress, so they might flock around these two. This makes it likely that you can find and meet them there.

More advanced ideas:

- one audience for each **publication** they read
- one audience for each **conference** they attend
- one audience for each **author** they read
- anyway, one audience for each person or thing your audience might be interested in
