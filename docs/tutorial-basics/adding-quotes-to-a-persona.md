# Adding quotes to a persona

After creating a persona, you can add quotes from real people in one or more of your audiences:

1. Open an audience that you have
2. Search for good quotes to add. Here we have clicked on the keyword `difficult` where people talk about problems with SEO
3. Click on the **little icon below each tweet**, and a grey area with your existing personas opens up
4. Click on a persona's fake profile image (e.g. **Jim Blogger**), to attribute this tweet to them, as a quote:

When you have collected enough quotes, go back to your persona's page, to have a look at the collected quotes:

1. Click on `Personas`
2. Find the name of your persona (e.g. Jim Blogger) and click on it
3. You see the persona and their quotes from real people, if you scroll down a little:

:::warning
In this case, **I have made a mistake**: I attributed a quote from an SEO professional to Jim Blogger, whom I want to describe as having "only limited SEO skills".

:::caution
Make sure that the tweets that you add as quotes really underline the point that you want to make with your persona.
