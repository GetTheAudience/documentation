# Adding Jobs To Be Done to a persona

After creating a persona, you can add Jobs To Be Done to the persona. **Why would you want to do that?**

:::info
A **Job To Be Done** (short form: **JTBD**) is a job that your persona wants to get done. 
:::

Example: **Jim Blogger** (the sample persona from the previous chapter) will want to write blog posts, share them on social media, and do SEO to get more eyeballs on his posts.

**If you know these jobs, you can create solutions for your persona that will help them get these jobs done.**

The real people who represent that persona will tell you whether you got their jobs right or not. **They will very likely buy your solution** if it solves the problems they have while they try to get those jobs done.

:::tip
Later, you will be able to invite the real people to interviews – run a real **JTBD interview** with each of them, to find out what their problems and needs are.

## How to add JTBD to your persona

You describe your persona's JTBD as a short [Job Story](https://www.intercom.com/blog/accidentally-invented-job-stories/) with three sentences:

- When… (situation)
- I want to… (motivation)
- So I can… (outcome)

To add Jobs To Be Done to a persona, take these steps here:

1. Open a persona that you have (use the `Personas` menu, and click on one persona)
2. Click on the `Jobs To Be Done` tab
3. Write the persona's situation into `Situation`
4. Write the persona's motivation into `Motivation`
5. Write the persona's desired outcome into `Outcome`
