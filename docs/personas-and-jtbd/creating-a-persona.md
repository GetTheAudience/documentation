# Creating a persona

A “Persona” is a fictional representation of an actual user of your product. Use them to…

* **Drive design decisions** by taking common user needs to design a new feature
* **Get a clear understanding** of users, in terms of goals and challenges
* **Analyze the jobs** that this persona wants to get done with your product

Personas can be immensely **helpful** for you as an entrepreneur or creator because **you paint a clear picture** of your current understanding of your audience members. You can share this with your colleagues so that you all work towards the same goals.

## Create the persona itself

You can create a persona, using these steps:

1. In the menu on the left, click on `Personas`
2. Click the button `Create first persona` (or `Create another persona`)
3. Enter a `name` and a short `About` text with a basic statement that characterizes your persona
4. Confirm with `Create persona`.

In this example, we create a persona called **Jim Blogger**, assuming that you want to help bloggers with a product or service you will design later, as soon as you know more about the jobs that a blogger needs to get done:

## Fill it with your assumptions

You will now get into a more elaborate view of your persona where you can **write down everything you know or assume** about this fictional representation (called "Jim Blogger" in this example):

1. their `attitude` in general
2. the `behavior` you observed or assumed
3. the `goals` they have
4. the `challenges` they face
5. you can also adapt the `About` text once more

Click on the small **pencil icon** next to **Attitude**, **Behavior**, **Goals**, **Challenges**, or **About**.

A box will appear that you can fill with text. Format the text with Markdown syntax if you like, e.g. bullet point lists with a minus sign before each sentence.

Finally, confirm your edit with the **TAB key**.

As a step `6`, you can **upload a fake profile image** that represents your idea of what a typical user of your product might look like ([Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) has lots of free photos, by the way).

After step 6, your blogger persona might look like this:
